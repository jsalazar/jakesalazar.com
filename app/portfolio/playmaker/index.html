Teachers help young people have the confidence and the skills to tackle big problems. They help youth realize their vision and develop new aspirations. Teachers foster scientists, writers, and artists. They inspire politicians, activists, and health professionals. And, because the children of today are the adults of tomorrow, teachers are pivotal in shaping society. Teachers grow the next generation of social change agents—those who will fight injustice, rebuild economies, strengthen democracy, cure cancer, and promote human rights. The plays they make today infinitely impact our tomorrow. By providing the opportunities for our young people to grow and learn, teachers can change our country, and ultimately the world. </p> </div> <div class="playmaker-text playmaker-col border-l"> <p> From the very beginning, our program prepares students for this work. We place our students in classrooms where they learn to understand young people and are able to observe practicing professionals. They experience ways to contend with core challenges of teaching practice. In these environments, our students begin to develop specific ways of achieving success. They receive focused feedback from practicing teachers, university instructors, and their peers. Starting on day one, we prepare our students to be capable of developing young people, with the goal of achieving a more socially just, diverse, and productive society. <br> <br> <strong>We create playmakers. <br>Are you one?</strong> </p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3"> <div class=playmaker-profile> <span class=visible-xs-block>Playmaker<strong>Profile</strong></span> <img src=images/fcab4935.jeff-scheur-playmaker.gif alt="JEFF SCHEUR"> <span class=visible-lg-block>Playmaker<strong>Profile</strong></span> <h2>JEFF SCHEUR</h2> <p> Founder/CEO, NoRedInk.com <br> San Francisco, California </p> <div> <strong>MA, EDUCATION—MAJORS IN ENGLISH <br> AND ECONOMICS, WITH SECONDARY <br> TEACHER CERTIFICATION (SECMAC), 2004</strong> <br> <br> Jeff taught high school English for eight years, ran a national championship debate team in Chicago Public Schools, and received National Board Certification in 2011. After grading 15,000 English papers, he created NoRedInk.com, a website to help students improve their grammar and writing skills by providing easy access to valuable learning resources. <br> <br> “Like so many educators, I wondered how I could develop more efficient systems to help my students quickly address their misconceptions. It’s no secret that learners need immediate feedback, curriculum that stems from their interests, and lots of practice in order to show rapid growth, and yet teachers can only do so much with large classes and limited time. I created NoRedInk to help my students improve their skills with engaging material....My time at the School of Education left me very prepared for a career as a lifelong educator.” </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section id=section-top-ten class=section-top-ten> <div class=section-heading> <div class=section-heading-border> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"> <div class=section-header> <div class="left-dashed-arrow visible-lg-inline-block"></div> <h2>Top Tier</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3"> <div class=top-u-container> <div class=top-u> U </div> </div> <div class=top-dots data-sr="reset wait 0.5s, then enter bottom and hustle 50px over 2s"> <img src=images/b3293fa9.top-dots.png class=visible-lg-inline-block alt="TOP TEN"> <img src=images/b3293fa9.top-dots.png style="width: 150px" class="visible-xs-inline-block visible-sm-inline-block" alt="TOP TEN"> <strong>RANKED</strong> </div> <div class=top-four-container> <div class=top-four data-sr="reset enter from the top and scale up 30% over 1.5s please"> <img src=images/numbertwo.png alt="Number 2 among elementary education programs"> <h2>among elementary education programs</h2> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4"> <div class=top-two-faculty-container style="border-left: 1px solid #f2f2f2"> <div class="top-two clearfix" data-sr="reset move 400px and enter right over 1.1s"> <div class=top-two-a>#2 <!-- <img src="images/99369368.num-two.png" alt="#2"> --> </div> <div class=top-two-b> <em>IN</em><br> SECONDARY <br> <span>EDUCATION</span> </div> </div> <div class="top-faculty clearfix"> <h2>OUR FACULTY</h2> <img src=images/88fb0cff.faculty.png alt="Leading scholars"> <ul> <li><span>Leading scholars on teaching and learning</span></li> <li><span>Experienced classroom teachers</span></li> <li><span>Experts on educational access and opportunity</span></li> <li><span>Skilled in government administration, policy, and educational systems around the world</span></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class=top-graduates-container> <div class=top-graduates> <h2>WHERE DO OUR GRADUATES TEACH?

to ensure that our approach to preparation supports our
graduates in successfully teaching all children.

Bob is one of the chief architects of the Big History Project, an international research and development project to facilitate the global teaching of “Big History” to secondary students. Big History is an exciting, new, and interdisciplinary way to look at our history from the Big Bang to the present day, covering almost 14 billion years. In creating the secondary course for the Big History Project, Bob’s goal was to support students in developing a more connected world view and better critical thinking skills. “We live in a world that is interconnected, and what Big History does is it forces us to think of things in multiple scales—multiple time scales, multiple spatial scales. We can no longer afford to be thinking about things in narrow little pockets of either time or space. Big History is a global history for the world in which we live.” </p> <div class=inspire-container style="margin-top: 32px"> <div class=inspire-question-1> DO YOU HAVE <br>WHAT IT TAKES </div> <div class=inspire-question-2> TO INSPIRE <br>THE NEXT <br>GENERATION OF <br>INNOVATORS?<br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5" style="border-left: 1px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2"> <div class=te-programs> <div class=te-program> <h2>UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS</h2> <p> We offer bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees.

We were also taught that the only way we can correctly challenge and set high expectations for our students is by first knowing whom we are teaching. We had multiple opportunities to talk to students about who they were, what they liked to do, what experiences shaped them, and who they want to be.

Enthusiastic about the results, Jonathan launched Flipping Physics, an online video business, to spread his approach to teaching.

To “make physics education fun and real” and to “teach physics to as many people as possible.” <br><br> “The MAC program not only prepared me to be a great teacher, it also provided me the creative freedom to be able to think beyond the classroom.

They are the influencers and the entrepreneurs who seek to inspire those who will go on to stem climate change, create new art forms, rebuild economies, and drive social change. Their sphere of influence is immeasurable. They inspire the big ideas, and they thrive for the big challenges. Unafraid of difficult questions, they are intellectually curious and passionate about improving their communities. Playmakers are not those who hide behind books or chalkboards–they engage communities and draft and inspire movements that improve lives. </p> <p>Playmakers are the teachers who change the lives that change our world.</p> <h4>ARE YOU UP TO THE CHALLENGE?</h4> </div> <hr> <div class=playmaker-text> <h2 class=text-blue>WHY<br><span class=text-maize>U-M?</span></h2> <p>The School of Education at the University of Michigan does not view teaching as a vocation–we view it as a profession. We view it as a way of developing leaders who are unafraid of addressing the complexities, the dynamic realities, and the profound inequalities of the world in which we live. Our program is one that not only serves the classroom, but prepares our graduates to pursue paths in government, administration, business, non-profits, and entrepreneurship. </p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6"> <div class=playmaker-text style="border: 3px dashed #00274c; padding:40px; background: #f2f2f2"> <h2 class=text-blue>TELL ME<br><span class=text-maize>MORE!</span></h2> <p>For more information on what the University of Michigan School of Education has to offer please fill out the form below.</p> <div id=loading></div> <div id=loadingStatus></div> <form action=tellMeMoreAction.php method=post name=tellMeMore id=tellMeMore role=form> <div class=form-group> <label for=tellMeFirstName>First Name:</label> <input class=form-control id=tellMeFirstName placeholder=""> </div> <div class=form-group> <label for=tellMeLastName>Last Name:</label> <input class=form-control id=tellMeLastName placeholder=""> </div> <div class=form-group> <label for=tellMeEmail>Email:</label> <input class=form-control id=tellMeEmail placeholder=""> </div> <div class=form-group> <label for=tellMeInterest>Are you interested in:</label> <select name="" class=form-control id=tellMeInterest> <option value="Teaching in elementary school">Teaching in elementary school <option value="Teaching in middle school">Teaching in middle school <option value="Teaching in high school">Teaching in high school <option value="Learning more about possibilities for me in teaching">Learning more about possibilities for me in teaching </select> </div> <div class=form-group> <label for=tellMeAreYou>Are you a:</label> <select name="" class=form-control id=tellMeAreYou> <option value="High school student">High school student <option value="U-M first year or sophomore">U-M first year or sophomore <option value="U-M junior or senior">U-M junior or senior <option value="Community college student or student looking to transfer to U-M">Community college student or student looking to transfer to U-M <option value="College graduate or career changer">College graduate or career changer </select> </div> <button type=submit class="btn btn-warning btn-lg btn-block">Tell Me More!</button> </form> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <!--

                                  Liz became a teacher because she wanted to facilitate educational access and student success in the face of persistent barriers and inequalities. These commitments are also central now to her work at Dawn Farm, an organization that seeks to remove the barriers to an addict’s successful recovery. In her role as project manager, Liz draws on her skills as an educator as she oversees critical aspects of the organization’s daily operations.

                                  “The School of Education [SOE], as well as my teaching experience in Ann Arbor Public Schools did an excellent job preparing me for this position. Although I was new to the substance abuse treatment world and the project manager position when I started, there were essential skills built upon at SOE, that allowed me to be successful in this position, including: organization and multitasking work, working well in team settings, having the ability to express an idea or plan in different ways to reach different types of thinkers and personalities, and small and large group presentation practice.”

Once I entered the field as a professional, I regularly recalled my lessons in my theory-based and teaching content courses, as well as in my practicum. As an administrator now, I am still able to use the knowledge I gained during my tenure as a student. My experience at the School of Education was world-class.”
