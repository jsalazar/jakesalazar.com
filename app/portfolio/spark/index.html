                            For nearly 100 years, the <strong>University of Michigan School of Education</strong> has helped
                            students discover how to turn passions into careers and careers into social impact.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Many of our students have discovered the field of education through coursework
                            introducing topics covered in our teacher education program &mdash; from psychology
                            and social justice to policy and leadership. Others have had experiences with
                            tutoring or coaching that provided roles in youth development and leadership.
                            And many were simply inspired by great teachers who made a difference in their

                            understanding of children as sense-makers who are capable of
                            developing deep understanding of content across disciplines.

                            School from other schools on the Ann Arbor campus or transfer
                            from other colleges and universities. Secondary teacher certification
                            students also have the option to stay in their U-M school or college.
                            Whether you are already on campus or considering a transfer, please
                            contact us early so that we can help you plan your coursework.

                            We accept first-year undergraduate students in a preferred
                            admissions program. These students complete their first two years
                            at another school at the University of Michigan (usually the College
                            of Literature, Science, and the Arts), while being advised by the
                            School prior to transferring to our program at the beginning of the
                            third year. Other U-M students apply to the School during their first
                            two years and formally transfer as juniors.

                            Science, and the Arts, we have options that allow you to earn your
                            degree while also earning a teaching certificate. Students interested
                            in music education must apply directly through the School of Music,
                            Theatre & Dance.

                        A degree from the U-M School of Education allows you to launch a
                        career and develop it in any direction you wish. Our career services
                        team provides comprehensive and tailored resources that empower
                        students and alumni to leverage skills and training to achieve and
                        maintain career success. If you choose to move out of Michigan,
                        as many graduates do, our career team will help you navigate the
                        process of obtaining certification in your new home state.

                        <p>
                        Many schools and organizations actively recruit our students, which
                        is evident from our high employment rates. Hiring managers,
                        principals, and superintendents are eager to employ graduates
                        from the School because they are familiar with the outstanding
                        professional preparation and leadership abilities demonstrated by
                        our alumni.
